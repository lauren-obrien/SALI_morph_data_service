Experiments with Queensland soils morphology data
-------------------------------------------------

This is all public data, but currently only (easily) accessible in PDF
decoded reports. Exploring alternatives.

Note that the datasets in this repo were last extracted from the Queensland SALI database in December 2019. As I have moved jobs, I no longer have the backend access required to update them. For fresh data, please contact soils@qld.gov.au.
